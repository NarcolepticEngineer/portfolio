## Instructions
* Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 
* Line 9- by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, folded in the corners.
* Pour bourbon and maple syrup into small saucepan and note roughly how high the liquid level is with a spoon.
* Simmer to reduce roughly by at least half the total volume or less (took about 30 min)
* Realize the oven is still on… turn it off.
* Remove saucepan from heat.
* Add unsweetened chocolate and butter, stir until melted all the way through. 
* Move to mixing bowl and put in refrigerator to chill.
* Forget about it for a few hours, and maybe it is ready when chocolate starts to congeal and bowl is cool to the touch all over.
* Re-preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
* Add sugar, stirring until well blended. 
* Beat in eggs (one at a time) until well blended. 
* Add flour (and I guess here I could have added more chocolate chips), and stir to incorporate. 
* Stop stirring when no traces of flour remain. 
* Spread in prepared pan.
* Bake for 25 minutes and check on it: *Oh shit this looks like it’s not going to work*
    * Bake for 5 more minutes: *Oh shit it looks worse*
    * Bake for 5 more minutes: *Oh shit it looks like split pudding*
    * Bake for 5 more minutes, stick with a toothpick and notice it just looks like chocolate syrup: *Oh shit this may be a lost cause*
    * **Fuck it**, Bake for 10 more minutes, stick with a toothpick and if you’re lucky it might come out with fudgy sludge… ***Holy shit I think it’s working!***
    * Bake for 5 more minutes (just in case), stick with a toothpick and it comes out with fudge crumbs: ***MWA-HA-HA-HA-ha! You think it might have worked!***
    * Remove from oven and cool in pan on wire rack. 
    * Remove brownies from pan: *Oh shit, its wobbly like pudding… is it cooked?*
    * TASTE TEST **BEFORE** YOU SERVE TO OTHERS. Just in case. It’s probably fine!
* Cut into squares.
* Set at least half aside for yourself (You’ll thank me later).
* Serve with disclaimer: 
    
    “It’s probably not raw, it’s just VERY fudgy. But… if you wouldn’t lick the batter off the spoon, better not eat this.”
    
* Enjoy!
