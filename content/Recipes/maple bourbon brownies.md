## Instructions
* Pour bourbon and maple syrup into small saucepan and measure how high the liquid level is with a wood skewer or chopstick notched carefully with a knife.
* Simmer to reduce roughly by at least half the total volume or less (30-45 min depending on how long your attention span is).
  
> [!Warning]
> This mixture boils over really REALLY easily. If it does, it will catch fire because *alchohol*, and be stiky because *syrup*.<br>
> (*It's a bitch to clean off burnt and sticky crap at the same time*.)

* Remove saucepan from heat.
* Add unsweetened chocolate and butter, stir until melted all the way through. 
* Move to mixing bowl and thouroughly blend in the sugar and vanilla and salt
* Put bowl in refrigerator to chill
  
> [!Tip]
> We need the mixture to be cool enough to add the eggs without cooking them

* Wait until bottom of the bowl is no longer warm to the touch before removing from refrigerator
* Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat the oven to 350°F.
* Line 9- by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, folded in the corners.
   * (Or aluminum foil - either non-stick foil or with non-stick spray)
* Beat in eggs until well blended. 
* Add flour, and stir to incorporate.

> [!Note]
> Add mix-ins if desired.<br>
> I always recommend **MORE CHOCOLATE**.<br>
> I've had the best luck using about a cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.

* Spread in prepared pan.
* Bake for 25 minutes and check on it to see if a toothpick comes out clean

> [!Tip]
> Have a drink of that bourbon while waiting.

> [!Caution]
> It may not be done as expected depending on lot of factors in and/or outside of your control. <br><br>
>  This is an example of how it's gone for me: <br>
    * Check after 25 minutes: **Oh fuck oh shit this is goopy as shiiiit** <br>
    * Bake for 5 more minutes: **Oh shit it looks worse** <br>
    * Bake for 5 more minutes: **Oh shit it looks like pudding** <br>
    * Bake for 5 more minutes, stick with a toothpick and notice it just looks like chocolate syrup: **Oh shit this may be a lost cause** <br>
    * **Fuck it** 10 more minutes, stick with a toothpick and if you’re lucky it might come out with fudgy sludge… ***Holy shit I think it’s working!*** <br>
    * Bake for 5 more minutes (just in case), stick with a toothpick and it comes out with fudge crumbs: ***MWA-HA-HA-HA-ha! I am a genius!***
* Remove from oven and cool in pan on wire rack *until you think it's worth the risk of being burned to get a taste of the sweet sweet chocolate you worked so hard for*. 
  
> [!Tip]
> TASTE TEST **BEFORE** YOU SERVE TO OTHERS. <br>
> Just in case. <br>
> It’s probably fine!

* Cut into *tiiiiny* squares.
* Set at least half aside for yourself.

> [!Important]
> Serve with disclaimer that it’s probably not raw, it’s just VERY fudgy. <br>
> If you wouldn’t lick the batter off the spoon, better not eat this.
    
* Enjoy!
